Social media has gained immense popularity with marketing teams and
Twitter is an effective tool for a company to get people excited about
its products.
Twitter makes it easy to engage users and communicate directly with
them, and in turn, users can provide word-of-mouth marketing for
companies by discussing the products.


In this project we use Apache HDFS and Apache Hive to design an
end-to-end data pipeline that will enable us to analyze Twitter data.

Process:
First of all we will acquire data that we want to process. The data we
have here is
twitter feeds data in JSON format. It has different types of information
about feeds like text of tweet, sender of tweet, if tweet has been
resent? Etc.
The data is very much in structured form so we can store it in hive and
use hive QL queries to process it.
We will first create hive tables which have same schema as JSON data
of twitter
